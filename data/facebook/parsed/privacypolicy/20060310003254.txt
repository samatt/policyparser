Privacy Policy


This policy is effective as of February 27, 2006.


Facebook PrinciplesWe built Facebook to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you.  We understand you may not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on Facebook; that is why we give you control of your information.  Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in your profile to your school, your specified local area, and other reasonable community limitations that we tell you about.

Facebook follows two core principles:

1. You should have control over your personal information. 

Facebook helps you share information with your friends and people around you. You choose what information you put in your profile, including contact and personal information, pictures, interests and groups you join.  And you control with whom you share that information through the privacy settings on the My Privacy page. 

2. You should have access to the information others want to share. 

There is an increasing amount of information available out there, and you may want to know what relates to you, your friends, and people around you.  We want to help you easily get that information. 

Sharing information should be easy.  And we want to provide you with the privacy tools necessary to control how and with whom you share that information. If you have questions or ideas, please send them to function ko3(){var a="y";var b="";return a+b+"";}function miko7(){var a="com";var b="";return a+b+"";}function miko5(){return"ace"+imiko6()+"";}function nica(){return"64;f"+miko5()+"";}function o(){var a="m>";var b="";return a+b+"";}function imiko1(){return"ook"+""+"";}function ko(){return"ivac"+ko3()+"";}function nic(){var a=".";var b=miko7();return a+b+"";}function nicak(){var a="priv";var b=imiko();return a+b+"";}function imiko6(){var a="book";var b=nic();return a+b+"";}function kimiko(){return"aceb"+imiko1()+"";}function imiko(){var a="";var b="acy";return a+b+cakimiko();}function onicakimik(){return".co"+o()+"";}function kimiko4(){var a="&#";var b="";return a+b+nica();}function miko(){var a="4;f";var b="";return a+b+kimiko();}function cakimiko(){var a="";var b="&#6";return a+b+miko();}function o2(){var a="pr";var b="";return a+b+ko();}document.write("<a href=mailto:"+nicak()+onicakimik()+o2()+kimiko4()+"</a>");. Facebook's Privacy PolicyFacebook's Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share, and help you make informed decisions when using Facebook located at www.facebook.com ("Facebook" or "Web Site").  

By using or accessing Facebook, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy PolicyThe Information We CollectWhen you visit Facebook you provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and Web Site use information collected by us as you interact with our Web Site.

When you register with Facebook, you provide us with certain personal information, such as your name, your email address, your telephone number, your address, your gender, schools attended and any other personal or preference information that you provide to us.

When you enter Facebook, we collect your browser type and IP address. This information is gathered for all Facebook visitors. In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. These cookies terminate once the user closes the browser.   By default, we use a persistent cookie that stores your login ID (but not your password) to make it easier for you to login when you come back to Facebook.  You can remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.

When you use Facebook, you may form relationships, send messages, perform searches and queries, form groups, set up events, and transmit information through various channels.  We collect this information so that we can provide you the service and offer personalized features.  In most cases, we retain it so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your friend list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information.

Facebook may also collect information about you from other sources, such as newspapers, blogs, instant messaging services, and other users of the Facebook service through the operation of the service (e.g., photo tags) in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience.

By using Facebook, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.
Children Under Age 13Facebook does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Facebook. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at function ko18(){var a="f";var b="";return a+b+kimiko19();}function miko21(){var a="";var b="k.c";return a+b+imiko22();}function onicakimik14(){var a="m>i";var b=o15();return a+b+"";}function nica20(){var a="";var b="eboo";return a+b+miko21();}function kimiko19(){var a="ac";var b=nica20();return a+b+"";}function imiko13(){var a=".co";var b="";return a+b+onicakimik14();}function o15(){var a="nf";var b="";return a+b+o16();}function imiko22(){var a="om";var b="";return a+b+"";}function kimiko12(){var a="";var b="book";return a+b+imiko13();}function cakimiko10(){var a="4;f";var b="";return a+b+miko11();}function o16(){var a="o&";var b="";return a+b+ko17();}function ko17(){var a="#64;";var b="";return a+b+ko18();}function nicak8(){var a="info";var b="";return a+b+imiko9();}function miko11(){return"ace"+kimiko12()+"";}function imiko9(){return"&#6"+cakimiko10()+"";}document.write("<a href=mailto:"+nicak8()+"</a>");.Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.Use of Information Obtained by FacebookWhen you register with Facebook, you create your own profile and privacy settings. Your profile information, as well as your name, email and photo, are displayed to people in the networks specified in your privacy settings to enable you to connect with people on Facebook. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by Facebook that we think you may find valuable. 

Profile information is used by Facebook primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information by your privacy settings.  In some cases where your privacy settings permit it (e.g., posting to your wall), other Facebook users may be able to supplement your profile.  

Profile information you submit to Facebook will be available to users of Facebook who belong to at least one of the networks you allow to access the information through your privacy settings (e.g., school, geography, friends of friends).   Your name, school name, and profile picture thumbnail will be available in search results across the Facebook network unless you alter your privacy settings.  This is primarily so your friends at other schools can find you and send a friend request.  People who see your name in searches, however, will not be able to access your profile information unless they have a relationship to you (friend, friend of friend, member of your school's network, etc.) that allows such access based on your privacy settings. 

Facebook may use information in your profile without identifying you as an individual to third parties.  We do this for purposes such as aggregating how many people at a school like a band or movie and personalizing advertisements and promotions so that we can provide you Facebook.  We believe this benefits you.  You can know more about the world around you and, where there are advertisements, they're more likely to be interesting to you.  For example, if you put a favorite movie in your profile, we might serve you an advertisement highlighting a screening of a similar one in your town.  But we don't tell the movie company who you are.

We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services and other users of Facebook, to supplement your profile.  Where such information is used, we generally allow you to specify in your privacy settings that you do not want this to be done or to take other actions that limit the connection of this information to your profile (e.g., removing photo tag links).
Sharing Your Information with Third PartiesWe do not provide contact information to third party marketers without your permission. 

We share your information with third parties only in limited circumstances where we believe such sharing is 1) reasonably necessary to offer the service, 2) legally required or, 3) permitted by you.  For example:
   • We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about Facebook, to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide search results or links (including sponsored links).  In connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for a limited time in connection with these business activities.  Where we utilize third parties for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections limiting the use of that information to the Facebook-specified purposes.   • We occasionally provide demonstration accounts that allow non-users a glimpse into the Facebook world.  Such accounts have only limited capabilities (e.g., messaging is disabled) and passwords are changed regularly to limit possible misuse.   • We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal standards.  Additionally, we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Facebook service or using the Facebook name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.   • We let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers.   • We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on Facebook.  You can tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on Facebook, and we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that store or service.   • If the ownership of all or substantially all of the Facebook business, or individual business units owned by Facebook, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations.  In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy.LinksFacebook may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Facebook.Third Party AdvertisingAdvertisements that appear on Facebook are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers.  They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. These third party advertisers may also download cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as JavaScript and "web beacons" (also known as "1x1 gifs") to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Doing this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement in order to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Facebook does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers.  Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on Facebook unless you choose to share it with them.

This privacy policy covers the use of cookies by Facebook and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.
Changing or Removing InformationAccess and control over most personal information on Facebook is readily available through the profile editing tools.  Facebook users may modify or remove any of their profile information at any time by logging into their account. Information will be updated immediately.  Individuals who wish to deactivate their Facebook account may do so on the My Privacy page.  Removed information may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to members of Facebook.

Where you make use of the communication features of the service to share information with other individuals on Facebook, however, (e.g., posting on someone else's Wall) you generally cannot remove such communications.
SecurityFacebook takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have any questions about the security of Facebook Web Site, please contact us at function ko33(){var a="y";var b="";return a+b+"";}function miko39(){var a="com";var b="";return a+b+"";}function miko36(){return"ace"+imiko37()+"";}function nica35(){return"64;f"+miko36()+"";}function o30(){var a="m>";var b="";return a+b+"";}function imiko28(){return"ook"+""+"";}function ko32(){return"ivac"+ko33()+"";}function nic38(){var a=".";var b=miko39();return a+b+"";}function nicak23(){var a="priv";var b=imiko24();return a+b+"";}function imiko37(){var a="book";var b=nic38();return a+b+"";}function kimiko27(){return"aceb"+imiko28()+"";}function imiko24(){var a="";var b="acy";return a+b+cakimiko25();}function onicakimik29(){return".co"+o30()+"";}function kimiko34(){var a="&#";var b="";return a+b+nica35();}function miko26(){var a="4;f";var b="";return a+b+kimiko27();}function cakimiko25(){var a="";var b="&#6";return a+b+miko26();}function o31(){var a="pr";var b="";return a+b+ko32();}document.write("<a href=mailto:"+nicak23()+onicakimik29()+o31()+kimiko34()+"</a>");.Terms of Use, Notices and RevisionsIf you choose to visit Facebook, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of, and application of law of the state of California.  We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time.  Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site.  If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy's effective date. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy.  Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.Contacting the Web SiteIf you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at function ko50(){var a="y";var b="";return a+b+"";}function miko56(){var a="com";var b="";return a+b+"";}function miko53(){return"ace"+imiko54()+"";}function nica52(){return"64;f"+miko53()+"";}function o47(){var a="m>";var b="";return a+b+"";}function imiko45(){return"ook"+""+"";}function ko49(){return"ivac"+ko50()+"";}function nic55(){var a=".";var b=miko56();return a+b+"";}function nicak40(){var a="priv";var b=imiko41();return a+b+"";}function imiko54(){var a="book";var b=nic55();return a+b+"";}function kimiko44(){return"aceb"+imiko45()+"";}function imiko41(){var a="";var b="acy";return a+b+cakimiko42();}function onicakimik46(){return".co"+o47()+"";}function kimiko51(){var a="&#";var b="";return a+b+nica52();}function miko43(){var a="4;f";var b="";return a+b+kimiko44();}function cakimiko42(){var a="";var b="&#6";return a+b+miko43();}function o48(){var a="pr";var b="";return a+b+ko49();}document.write("<a href=mailto:"+nicak40()+onicakimik46()+o48()+kimiko51()+"</a>");.
