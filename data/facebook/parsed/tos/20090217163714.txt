          or disable access to any User Content."User Content" means any photos, text, link,

          party's IP rights. When we receive a proper claim of IP infringement,
          we promptly remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing User
          Content. We also terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in
          appropriate circumstances. If you believe that User Content on the
          Facebook Service infringes your IP rights, please visit our How to Report Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement page. All IP
          claims can be made through that page, including any copyright claims,
          which will be handled in accordance with the Digital Millennium
          Copyright Act. If you are a user whose User Content was removed due to
          alleged copyright infringement, and you believe the removal was
          mistaken, please visit our How to Appeal Claims of Copyright Infringement page.MobileThere are features of the Facebook Service that
          may be accessible via certain mobile carriers (the "Mobile
          Services"). While we currently do not charge for these Mobile
          Services, your carrier's normal messaging, data and other rates and
          fees will still apply. By using the Mobile Services, you agree that we
          may communicate with you by SMS, MMS, text message or other electronic
          means to your mobile device, and that certain information about your
          usage of the Mobile Services may be communicated to us. In the event
          you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to
          promptly update your account information on the Facebook Service to
          ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires
          your old number.Third Party Applications and Connect SitesThe "Facebook Platform" is a set of APIs and
          services that third parties may use to (a) create applications for use
          on the Facebook Service ("Applications") and (b) enable their websites
          to work like Applications ("Connect Sites") through Facebook Connect
          ("Connect"). Applications and Connect Sites will be referred to
          together as "Applications/Connect Sites," which should be read as
          Applications and/or Connect Sites.If you authorize an Application or allow a
          Connect Site to connect with your account on the Facebook Service, you
          agree that such Application/Connect Site can (a) access information on
          the Facebook Service related to you (including your profile
          information, friends and privacy settings) and (b) generate and
          publish news feed and other stories about actions you take on such
          Application/Connect Site without any additional permission. If you
          want to change the information that Applications/Connect Sites can
          access, you may modify your privacy settings. If you no longer want
          these news feed or other stories to be published, you can disable this
          feature by changing your application settings. If you, your friends
          or members of your network use any Application/Connect Site, such
          Applications/Connect Sites may access and share certain information
          about you with others in accordance with your privacy settings.Once you allow a Connect Site to connect with
          your account on the Facebook Service, you will be able to use your
          login information for the Facebook Service to log into and interact
          with your friends on that Connect Site. In order to make Connect
          possible, you agree to allow us to check your cookies for the Facebook
          Service when you are visiting Connect Sites. When your friends connect
          their account on the Facebook Service with a Connect Site, Connect
          will enable them to find friends on the Facebook Service that may also
          be users of that Connect Site and invite them to use Connect as well.
          If you do not want your friends to be able to invite you to connect on
          a Connect Site, you may change your privacy settings to disable
          this feature. Even if you have not gone through the Connect process,
          you may be able to authorize a Connect Site to generate and publish
          news feed and other stories about an action or all actions that you
          take on that Connect Site. If you want to change your settings for
          that Connect Site, visit your application settings.Your Privacy PracticesWe respect the privacy rights of third parties,
          and you must do so as well on the Facebook Service.If you collect, access or use information relating to any user of the Facebook Service (including information contained in any user profile) you must obtain consent from the user and make it clear to the user that the collection, access and use is being carried out by you and not Facebook.Gift CreditsYou must be authorized to use the credit card,
          debit card or other payment source ("Card") you provide to purchase
          gift credits. By purchasing gift credits, you authorize Facebook or
          its designated payment processor to charge the purchase amount (plus
          any applicable tax) to your Card. By providing your Card account
          information to Facebook, you authorize us to collect and store it and
          other related transaction information.When you purchase gift credits, you are
          purchasing only a limited license to use certain features on the
          Facebook Service that will enhance your experience on the Facebook
          Service, such as giving virtual gifts to your friends. Gift credits
          have no real value, are non-refundable and are not redeemable for any
          sum of money or monetary value from Facebook at any time. Facebook
          does not guarantee the transferability of gift credits. Gift credits
          may not be transferred to any third party outside of the Facebook
          Service and may not be used as a means to transfer money to a third
          party. You agree that Facebook has the absolute right to manage,
          regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate gift credits as it sees
          fit, and Facebook will have no liability to you for exercising such
          rights.Ownership; Proprietary RightsExcept for User Content and Applications/Connect

          Facebook's share link button, logo and/or text (a "Share Link"),
          including all trademarks therein, on your website for the sole purpose
          of enabling users to Post links or content from your website on the
          Facebook Service. By offering a Share Link on your website, you agree,

          any such Submission for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without
          acknowledgment or compensation to you.User Disputes; ComplaintsYou agree not to hold Facebook responsible or
          liable for the User Content or actions of third parties (including

          as the collection, handling and sharing of personal information that
          you provide to third parties. If you have a dispute with a third party
          relating to the Facebook Service, you release Facebook and its
          directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Facebook
          Entities") from any claims, causes of action and damages (actual and
          consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising
          out of or in any way connected with such dispute. If you are a
          California resident, you waive California Civil Code Â§1542, which
          says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor
          does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of
          executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
          affected his settlement with the debtor."If you believe that the Facebook Service or

          unlawful, you agree to bring it to the attention of Facebook's legal
          department. If you do not report the issue or continue using the

          claim that the Facebook Service is unfair, fraudulent or unlawful with
          respect to that issue.IndemnityYou agree to indemnify and hold Facebook

          of or related to your (a) use of the Facebook Service or any of the
          applications, features, content or materials related thereto; (b)
          violation of these Terms; (c) violation of the rights of any other
