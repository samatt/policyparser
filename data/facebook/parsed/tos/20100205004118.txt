					Statement of Rights and Responsibilities

					This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement") derives from the Facebook Principles, and governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement.


Privacy 

							Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.


Sharing Your Content and Information 

							You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:


								For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos ("IP content"), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook ("IP License"). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.

								When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).

								When you add an application and use Platform, your content and information is shared with the application. We require applications to respect your privacy settings, but your agreement with that application will control how the application can use the content and information you share. (To learn more about Platform, read our About Platform page.)

								When you publish content or information using the "everyone" setting, it means that everyone, including people off of Facebook, will have access to that information and we may not have control over what they do with it.

								We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).



Safety 

							We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:


								You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.

								You will not collect users' content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.

								You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook.

								You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.

								You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.

								You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.

								You will not post content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.

								You will not develop or operate a third party application containing, or advertise or otherwise market alcohol-related or other mature content without appropriate age-based restrictions.

								You will not offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes ("promotion") on Facebook without our prior written consent. If we consent, you take full responsibility for the promotion, and will follow our Promotions Guidelines and all applicable laws.

								You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.

								You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of Facebook, such as a denial of service attack.

								You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.



Registration and Account Security 

							Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:


								You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.

								You will not use your personal profile for your own commercial gain (such as selling your status update to an advertiser).

								You will not use Facebook if you are under 13.

								You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.

								You will not share your password, let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.

								You will not transfer your account to anyone without first getting our written permission.

								If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).



Protecting Other People's Rights 

							We respect other people's rights, and expect you to do the same.


								You will not post content or take any action on Facebook that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.

								We can remove any content or information you post on Facebook if we believe that it violates this Statement.

								We will provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights. To learn more, visit our How to Report Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement page.

								If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.

								If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.

								You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including Facebook, the Facebook and F Logos, FB, Face, Poke, Wall and 32665), or any confusingly similar marks, without our written permission.

								If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not Facebook) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.

								You will not post anyone's identification documents or sensitive financial information on Facebook.

								You will not send email invitations to non-users without their consent.
