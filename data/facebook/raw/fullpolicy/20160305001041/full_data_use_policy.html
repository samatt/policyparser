We may provide these partners with information about the reach and effectiveness of their advertising without providing information that personally identifies you, or if we have aggregated the information so that it does not personally identify you. For example, we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally identifying demographic information (such as 25 year old female, in Madrid, who likes software engineering) to these partners to help them understand their audience or customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by our <a href="/web/20160305001041/http://www.facebook.com/ad_guidelines.php">advertiser guidelines</a>. </div><div class="mvm uiP fsm">Please review your <a href="/web/20160305001041/http://www.facebook.com/help/769828729705201/">advertising preferences</a> to understand why you’re seeing a particular ad on Facebook.

We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, we may provide information to third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud and abuse on and off of our Services.
