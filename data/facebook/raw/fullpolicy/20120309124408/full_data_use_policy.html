Your User ID helps the application personalize your experience because it can connect your account on that application with your Facebook account, and it can access your <a href="#publicinfo">public information</a>. This includes the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available.

Age range (e.g., 18-21) lets applications provide you with age-appropriate content. Locale (e.g., en-US) lets applications know what language you speak. Gender lets applications refer to you correctly. If you do not want applications to receive this information about you, you can turn off all Facebook applications using your Privacy Settings.<br/><img class="img" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20120309124408im_/https://fbcdn_dragon-a.akamaihd.net/cfs-ak-snc6/84980/923/233641236679183_1009183043.png" alt=""/> Sometimes a game console, mobile phone, or other device might ask for permission to share specific information with the games and applications you use on that device (such as your public information).

To get the full benefit of that application, your friend would want to give the application her friend list – which includes your User ID – so the application knows which of her friends is also using it. Your friend might also want to share the music you “like” on Facebook. If you have made that information public, then the application can access it just like anyone else.

But the site is contractually required to delete your data if you ask it to.<br/><div class="mvm uiP fsm"></div><b>How it works</b><br/> To join the instant personalization program, a potential partner must enter into an agreement with us designed to protect your privacy. For example, this agreement requires that the partner delete your data if you turn off instant personalization when you first visit the site. It also prevents the partner from accessing any information about you until you or your friends visit its site.<br/><div class="mvm uiP fsm">Instant personalization partners sometimes use an email hash process to see if any of their users are on Facebook and get those users&#039; User IDs. This process is similar to searching for someone on Facebook using an email address, except in this case the email addresses are encrypted so no actual email addresses are exchanged. The partner is also contractually required not to use your User ID for any purpose (other than associating it with your account) until you or your friends visit the site.</div><div class="mvm uiP fsm">When you visit an instant personalization site, we provide the site with your User ID and your friend list (as well as your age range, locale, and gender). The site can then connect your account on that site with your friends&#039; accounts to make the site instantly social. The site can also access public information associated with any of the User IDs it receives, which it can use to make the site instantly personalized. For example, if the site is a music site, it can access your music interests to suggest songs you may like, and access your friends&#039; music interests to let you know what they are listening to. Of course it can only access you or your friends’ music interests if they are public.

For example, an advertiser can choose to target 18 to 35 year-old women who live in the United States and like basketball. </div><div class="mvm uiP fsm">Try this tool yourself to see one of the ways advertisers target ads and what information they see at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120309124408/https://www.facebook.com/ads/create/">https://www.facebook.com/ads/create/</a></div><div class="mvm uiP fsm">If the advertiser chooses to run the ad (also known as placing the order), we serve the ad to people who meet the criteria the advertiser selected, but we do not tell the advertiser who any of those people are.

But there&#039;s a lot to read in News Feed. That&#039;s why we allow people to &quot;sponsor&quot; your stories to make sure your friends see them. For example, if you RSVP to an event hosted by a local restaurant, that restaurant may want to make sure your friends see it so they can come too. If they do sponsor a story, that story will appear in the same place ads usually do under the heading &quot;Sponsored Stories&quot; or something similar.
